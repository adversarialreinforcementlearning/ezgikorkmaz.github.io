I am a machine learning researcher and a PhD candidate in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I hold a Masters of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I wrote my MSc thesis at University of California, Berkeley. My research focus is robustness and generalization in machine learning. Currently, I am at DeepMind.
